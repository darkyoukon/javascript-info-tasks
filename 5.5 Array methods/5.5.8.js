console.log("The eighth task: Map to objects");

// You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.

// Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.

// For instance:

let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

let users = [john, pete, mary];

let usersMapped = users.map((item) => ({
  id: item.id,
  fullName: [item.name, item.surname].join(" "),
}));

/*
usersMapped = [
  { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
  { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
  { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
]
*/

console.log(usersMapped[0].id); // 1
console.log(usersMapped[0].fullName); // John Smith
// So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. There’s a small catch.
